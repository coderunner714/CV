  <p>Rachel grew up on a farm doing useful but occasionally disgusting things. She then escaped that life by going to school for 14 years. When she was done she realized she didn't
    really like that thing any more, but she persisted for a bit of time. All the while, she was drifting through life, meeting cool people, learning cool things...but something
    was missing. One night in March of 2021, she had dinner with a long-time friend of hers and while she had always felt strongly for him, those feeling had never been allowed to bloom
    and were lying dormant. How dormant, she wasn't sure. As it turns out...not very. That night she felt a lot of things. Sezual attraction, hope, longing, delight, friendship, regret,
    confusion. Love. She left that dinner and couldn't stop thinking about her friend, and so made plans to see him again in a few months. She cleared a few roadblocks, and in July of 2021, they
    had dinner again. TBC...</p>
